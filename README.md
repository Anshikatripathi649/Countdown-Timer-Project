Description-
<br>
A "countdown timer" in code refers to a programmed function that continuously decrements a set time value (like seconds, minutes, or days) until it reaches zero, typically displaying the remaining time in a user interface and triggering an action when it hits zero; essentially, it's a digital clock that counts down from a specified target date or time. 
<br>
Key points about countdown timers:
<br>
Functionality:
It calculates the time difference between the current time and a set future time, then displays the remaining time in a user-friendly format (e.g., days, hours, minutes, seconds). 
<br>
Implementation:
Most commonly implemented using programming language functions to access the system time and update the displayed time at regular intervals (like every second). 
<br>
Applications:
Used in various scenarios like website promotions with limited-time offers, event countdown clocks, online quizzes with time limits, and game mechanics
